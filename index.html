                GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/) is a proprietary developer platform that
                allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their
                code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and
                GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software
                feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and
                wikis for every project.[8] Headquartered in California, it has
                been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[9]

                It is commonly used to host open source software development
                projects.[10] As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over
                100 million developers[11] and more than 420 million
                repositories,[12] including at least 28 million public
                repositories.[13] It is the world's largest source code host as
                of June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were
                made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.[14]
